# Software Design Methodologies

1.

- Cohesion - describes how well the functions or classes within the program relate to each other and work together to perform a single task.
- Coupling - describes the links between different sections of the program and how much dependency there is on other parts of the code.

Good structured design has high cohesion and low coupling.

4. 
- **Encapsulation** - defines the way in which code is kept in the classes it belongs to in an organised way. A class will contain the properties and methods it needs, keeping it separate from the rest of the unrelated classes.
- **Abstraction** - hides details of how the code runs from the user, which is achieved by creating classes with methods which describe real objects.
- **Inheritance** - when a subclass inherits the properties and methods of a more general superclass.
- **Polymorphism** - describes components as appearing in many forms, for example, it enables multiple methods to be created with the same name and a similar purpose but each with a way to process different inputs.
