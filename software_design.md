# Software Design Methodologies

1.

- Cohesion - describes how well the functions or classes within the software system relate to each other and work to perform a single task.
- Coupling - describes the links between parts of the program and how much dependency there is on other parts of the code.

Good structured design has high cohesion and low coupling.
